# Bubble-Sort-vs-Selection-Sort

This project includes the basics of arrays and sorting algorithms using Java. It aims to determine which algorithm is faster by testing Selection Sort and BubbleSort. 

How does it work: It randomly selects numbers between -100 and 100 and sorts them. Each time the sorting is performed, the program also calculates the time taken to determine the efficiency of the sorting algorithm.

Programming of this project was started and concluded during my summer internship in BTC IT Services.
